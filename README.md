# GAN_Rhythms
We tried to make a GAN learn rhythms from a rhythm textbook for the IA Song Constest 2021. It did give us some novel rhythms, but they could only be used because one of us is a crazy person who likes polyrhythms with prime durations. That is - the GAN did give novelty, but it was disconnected from any sense of intention.
